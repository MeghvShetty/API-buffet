# Overview  
Using the Open Weather Map API (https://openweathermap.org/api), all candidates must write a script in the programming language of their choice (python is preferred) that accomplishes the following tasks:

Take a user supplied zip code and make an API call for a 5 day forecast
Display the date
Display the high and low temperatures for each of the 5 days
Display how much precipitation there will be for each day
If there won't be any precipitation for a particular day, display 0
The output should be displayed like the following:

| Date | Temperature | Precipitation |   
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 3/8/2017|32/23|1.1|
|3/6/2017|31/20|0.51

etc...
The above are the minimum requirements and all candidates are free to add any additional features that they would like.  Please be aware that there is no need to spend any money on this challenge. The openweatherapi site offers the "5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast" API endpoint for free.

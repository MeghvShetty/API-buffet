# Weather App Overview 

App build will do the following:
 - Take a city name as required input
 - Take an optional flag to display the output in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius, if desired
 - Call an online weather API to fetch the weather data
 - Display the city name, the current weather conditions, and the current temperature
 - Format the output visually using colors, spacing, and emojis

 The App works with Pythonâ€™s built-in argparse module, which assists you in creating user-friendly CLI apps, for example by providing a useful --help option out of the box.

 Note: Writing great command-line interfaces can be challenging. You want your app to be user-friendly and still provide all the functionality you need. Using higher-level libraries might make it easier for you to build out your applications.
